# Instanews Project

## Created by Dylan Kocsis

### Features

This website makes use of an API to populate the page with stories from the New York Times. It also uses SCSS styling elements.

### Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates effective understanding of HTML & CSS elements. Further, it was my first time using an Ajax request to populate a webpage with JSON data. This project also makes use of SASS styling and JQuery actions. The development of this website was meant to provide me with additional practise in using these principals.
